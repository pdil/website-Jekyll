This is my personal github website, which will contain a portfolio of various programming, data analysis, and visualization projects and blog posts. It may also contain personal items such as photographs. Currently it is under construction and will be updated as more repositories are added to the github.

The content on this webpage will be presented in a more accessible and user-friendly manner than the github repositories.

This repository contains the files (e.g. html, layouts, plugins, etc.) used to generate my website using Jekyll. For the generated website files, see [pdil/_site](http://www.github.com/pdil/_site).
